Cross-platform replacement for the React Native's [DrawerLayoutAndroid](http://reactnative.dev/docs/drawerlayoutandroid.html) component.
Provides a compatible API while allows for the component to be used on both Android and iOS.
Please refer to [React Native docs](http://reactnative.dev/docs/drawerlayoutandroid.html) for the detailed usage for standard parameters.

## Usage:

`DrawerLayout` component isn't exported by default from the `react-native-gesture-handler` package. To use it, import it in the following way:

```js
import DrawerLayout from 'react-native-gesture-handler/DrawerLayout';
```

## Properties:

On top of the standard list of parameters DrawerLayout has an additional set of attributes to customize its behavior. Please refer to the list below:

### `drawerType`

possible values are: `front`, `back` or `slide` (default is `front`). Specifies the way the drawer will be displayed.
When set to `front` the drawer will slide in and out along with the gesture and will display on top of the content view.
When `back` is used the drawer displays behind the content view and can be revealed with gesture of pulling the content view to the side.
Finally `slide` option makes the drawer appear like it is attached to the side of the content view; when you pull both content view and drawer will follow the gesture.

Type `slide`:

<GifGallery>
  <img src={useBaseUrl('gifs/drawer-slide.gif')} width="280" />
</GifGallery>

Type `front`:

<GifGallery>
  <img src={useBaseUrl('gifs/drawer-front.gif')} width="280" />
</GifGallery>

Type `back`:

<GifGallery>
  <img src={useBaseUrl('gifs/drawer-back.gif')} width="280" />
</GifGallery>

### `edgeWidth`

number. Width of the invisible area on the edge of the screen, which can be dragged to open the drawer.

### `hideStatusBar`

boolean. When set to `true`, drawer component will use [StatusBar API](http://reactnative.dev/docs/statusbar.html) to hide the OS status bar when the drawer is dragged or idle in the `open` position.

### `statusBarAnimation`

possible values are: `slide`, `none` or `fade` (defaults to `slide`).
May be used in combination with `hideStatusBar` to select the animation used for hiding the status bar.
See [StatusBar API](http://reactnative.dev/docs/statusbar.html#statusbaranimation) docs.

### `overlayColor`

color (default `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)`) of the background overlay on top of the content window when the drawer is `open`.
This color animates from `0%` to `100%` opacity as drawer animates from `closed` to `open`.

### `renderNavigationView`

renderer function for the drawer componenet.
Provided with a `progress` SharedValue parameter that indicates the progress of drawer opening/closing (`0` when drawer is `closed` and `1` when `open`).
This can be used by the drawer component to animated its children while the drawer is opening or closing.

### `onDrawerClose`

function. This function is called when the drawer is closed.

### `onDrawerOpen`

function. This function is called when the drawer is opened.

### `onDrawerSlide`

function. This function is called as a drawer sliding open from touch events.
The progress of the drawer opening/closing is passed back as 0 when closed and 1 when opened.

### `onDrawerStateChanged`

function. This function is called when the status of the drawer changes. It takes two arguments:

- `newState: DrawerState` - state of the `Drawer`. It can be one of the following:
  - `Idle`
  - `Dragging`
  - `Settling`
- `drawerWillShow: boolean` - if `true`, `Drawer` is about to open.

### `enableTrackpadTwoFingerGesture` (iOS only)

Enables two-finger gestures on supported devices, for example iPads with trackpads.
If not enabled the gesture will require click + drag, with enableTrackpadTwoFingerGesture swiping with two fingers will also trigger the gesture.

### `children`

component or function. Children is a component which is rendered by default and is wrapped by drawer.
May also be a render function which takes a `progress` SharedValue as a parameter that indicates the animation progress, similarily to the `renderNavigationView` render function.

### `mouseButton(value: MouseButton)` (Web & Android only)

Allows users to choose which mouse button should handler respond to.
The enum `MouseButton` consists of the following predefined fields:

- `LEFT`
- `RIGHT`
- `MIDDLE`
- `BUTTON_4`
- `BUTTON_5`
- `ALL`

Arguments can be combined using `|` operator, e.g. `mouseButton(MouseButton.LEFT | MouseButton.RIGHT)`. Default value is set to `MouseButton.LEFT`.

### `enableContextMenu(value: boolean)` (Web only)

Specifies whether context menu should be enabled after clicking on underlying view with right mouse button. Default value is set to `false`.

## Methods

### `openDrawer(options)`

`openDrawer` accepts an optional `options` parameter, which is an object with the following optional properties:

`initialVelocity`: number, the initial velocity of the object attached to the spring. Default 0 (object is at rest).
`animationSpeed`: number, controls speed of the animation. Default 1.

### `closeDrawer(options)`

`closeDrawer` accepts an optional `options` parameter, which is an object with the following optional properties:

`initialVelocity`: number, the initial velocity of the object attached to the spring. Default 0 (object is at rest).
`animationSpeed`: number, controls speed of the animation. Default 1.

## Example:

See the [drawer example](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/blob/main/example/src/basic/horizontalDrawer/index.tsx) from GestureHandler Example App or view it directly on your phone by visiting [our expo demo](https://snack.expo.io/@adamgrzybowski/react-native-gesture-handler-demo).

```js
class DrawerExample extends Component {
  handleDrawerSlide = (status) => {
    // outputs a value between 0 and 1
    console.log(status);
  };

  renderDrawer = () => {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>I am in the drawer!</Text>
      </View>
    );
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <DrawerLayout
          drawerWidth={200}
          drawerPosition={DrawerLayout.positions.Right}
          drawerType="front"
          drawerBackgroundColor="#ddd"
          renderNavigationView={this.renderDrawer}
          onDrawerSlide={this.handleDrawerSlide}>
          <View>
            <Text>Hello, it's me</Text>
          </View>
        </DrawerLayout>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
