:::info
This component is a drop-in replacement for the `Pressable` component.
:::

`Pressable` is a component that can detect various stages of tap, press, and hover interactions on any of its children.

### Usage:

To use `Pressable`, import it in the following way:

```js
import { Pressable } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';
```

## Properties

### `children`

either children or a render function that receives a boolean reflecting whether
the component is currently pressed.

### `style`

either view styles or a function that receives a boolean reflecting whether
the component is currently pressed and returns view styles.

### `onPress`

called after `onPressOut` when a single tap gesture is detected.

### `onPressIn`

called before `onPress` when a touch is engaged.

### `onPressOut`

called before `onPress` when a touch is released.

### `onLongPress`

called immediately after pointer has been down for at least `delayLongPress` milliseconds (`500` ms by default).

After `onLongPress` has been called, `onPressOut` will be called as soon as the pointer is lifted and `onPress` will not be called at all.

### `cancelable`

whether a press gesture can be interrupted by a parent gesture such as a scroll event. Defaults to `true`.

### `onHoverIn` (Web only)

called when pointer is hovering over the element.

### `onHoverOut` (Web only)

called when pointer stops hovering over the element.

### `delayHoverIn` (Web only)

duration to wait after hover in before calling `onHoverIn`.

### `delayHoverOut` (Web only)

duration to wait after hover out before calling `onHoverOut`.

### `delayLongPress`

duration (in milliseconds) from `onPressIn` before `onLongPress` is called.

### `disabled`

whether the `Pressable` behavior is disabled.

### `hitSlop` (Android & iOS only)

additional distance outside of the view in which a press is detected and `onPressIn` is triggered.

Accepts values of type `number` or [`Rect`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/rect)

### `pressRetentionOffset` (Android & iOS only)

additional distance outside of the view (or `hitSlop` if present) in which a touch is considered a
press before `onPressOut` is triggered.

Accepts values of type `number` or [`Rect`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/rect)

### `android_disableSound` (Android only)

if `true`, doesn't play system sound on touch.

### `android_ripple` (Android only)

enables the Android ripple effect and configures its color, radius and other parameters.

Accepts values of type [`RippleConfig`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable#rippleconfig)

### `testOnly_pressed`

used only for documentation or testing (e.g. snapshot testing).

### `unstable_pressDelay`

duration (in milliseconds) to wait after press down before calling `onPressIn`.

### Example:

See the full [pressable example](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/blob/main/example/src/new_api/pressable/index.tsx) from `GestureHandler` example app.

import GestureStateFlowExample from '@site/src/examples/GestureStateFlowExample';

```js
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { Pressable } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';

export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Pressable
      style={({ pressed }) => (pressed ? styles.highlight : styles.pressable)}
      hitSlop={20}
      pressRetentionOffset={20}>
      <View style={styles.textWrapper}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Pressable!</Text>
      </View>
    </Pressable>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  pressable: {
    width: 120,
    height: 120,
    backgroundColor: 'mediumpurple',
    borderWidth: StyleSheet.hairlineWidth,
  },
  highlight: {
    width: 120,
    height: 120,
    backgroundColor: 'red',
    borderWidth: StyleSheet.hairlineWidth,
  },
  textWrapper: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    color: 'black',
  },
});
```
