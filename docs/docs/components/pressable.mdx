Pressable is a component that can detect various stages of tap, press and hover interactions on any of its defined children.

### Usage:

To use `Pressable`, import it in the following way:

```js
import { Pressable } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';
```

## Properties

### `onHoverIn`

Called when pointer is hovering over the element.

### `onHoverOut`

Called when pointer stops hovering over the element.

### `onPress`

Called when a single tap gesture is detected.

### `onPressIn`

Called before `onPress` when a touch is engaged.

### `onPressOut`

Called before `onPress` when a touch is released.

### `onLongPress`

Called when a long-tap gesture is detected.

### `children`

Either children or a render prop that receives a boolean reflecting whether
the component is currently pressed.

### `cancelable`

Whether a press gesture can be interrupted by a parent gesture such as a
scroll event. Defaults to true.

### `delayHoverIn` (Web only)

:::note
This prop is not present in the original pressable's React Native documentation.
:::

Duration to wait after hover in before calling `onHoverIn`.

### `delayHoverOut` (Web only)

:::note
This prop is not present in the original pressable's React Native documentation.
:::

Duration to wait after hover out before calling `onHoverOut`.

### `delayLongPress`

Duration (in milliseconds) from `onPressIn` before `onLongPress` is called.

### `disabled`

Whether the press behavior is disabled.

### `hitSlop`

Additional distance outside of this view in which a press is detected.

### `pressRetentionOffset`

Additional distance outside of this view in which a touch is considered a
press before `onPressOut` is triggered.

### `android_disableSound` (Android only)

If true, doesn't play system sound on touch.

### `android_ripple` (Android only)

Enables the Android ripple effect and configures its color.

### `testOnly_pressed`

Used only for documentation or testing (e.g. snapshot testing).

### `style`

Either view styles or a function that receives a boolean reflecting whether
the component is currently pressed and returns view styles.

### `unstable_pressDelay`

Duration (in milliseconds) to wait after press down before calling onPressIn.

See the full [pressable example](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/blob/main/example/src/new_api/pressable/index.tsx) from GestureHandler Example App.

import GestureStateFlowExample from '@site/src/examples/GestureStateFlowExample';

```js
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Pressable
      style={[styles.pressable, ({ pressed }) => (pressed ? highlight : {})]}
      hitSlop={20}
      pressRetentionOffset={20}>
      <View style={styles.textWrapper}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Pressable!</Text>
      </View>
    </Pressable>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  pressable: {
    width: 120,
    height: 120,
    backgroundColor: 'mediumpurple',
