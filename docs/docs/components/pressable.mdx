## Properties

### `onHoverIn`

Called when pointer is hovering over the element.

### `onHoverOut`

Called when pointer stops hovering over the element.

### `onPress`

Called when a single tap gesture is detected.

### `onPressIn`

Called before `onPress` when a touch is engaged.

### `onPressOut`

Called before `onPress` when a touch is released.

### `onLongPress`

Called when a long-tap gesture is detected.

### `children`

Either children or a render prop that receives a boolean reflecting whether
the component is currently pressed.

### `cancelable`

Whether a press gesture can be interrupted by a parent gesture such as a
scroll event. Defaults to true.
