import BaseEventData from './base-gesture-event-data.md';
import BaseEventConfig from './base-gesture-config.md';
import BaseEventCallbacks from './base-gesture-callbacks.md';

A discrete gesture that activates when the corresponding view is pressed for a sufficiently long time.
This gesture's state will turn into [END](../../under-the-hood/states-events.md#end) immediately after the finger is released.
The gesture will fail to recognize a touch event if the finger is lifted before the [minimum required time](#mindurationms) or if the finger is moved further than the [allowable distance](#maxdist).

## Config

### Properties specific to `LongPressGesture`:

### `minDuration(value: number)`

Minimum time, expressed in milliseconds, that a finger must remain pressed on the corresponding view. The default value is 500.

### `maxDistance(value: number)`

Maximum distance, expressed in points, that defines how far the finger is allowed to travel during a long press gesture. If the finger travels further than the defined distance and the gesture hasn't yet [activated](../../under-the-hood/states-events.md#active), it will fail to recognize the gesture. The default value is 10.

## Event data

### Event attributes specific to `LongPressGesture`:

### `x`

X coordinate, expressed in points, of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the view attached to the [`GestureDetector`](./gesture-detector.md).

### `y`

Y coordinate, expressed in points, of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the view attached to the [`GestureDetector`](./gesture-detector.md).

### `absoluteX`

X coordinate, expressed in points, of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the root view. It is recommended to use `absoluteX` instead of [`x`](#x) in cases when the view attached to the [`GestureDetector`](./gesture-detector.md) can be transformed as an effect of the gesture.

### `absoluteY`

Y coordinate, expressed in points, of the current position of the pointer (finger or a leading pointer when there are multiple fingers placed) relative to the root view. It is recommended to use `absoluteY` instead of [`y`](#y) in cases when the view attached to the [`GestureDetector`](./gesture-detector.md) can be transformed as an effect of the gesture.

### `duration`

Duration of the long press (time since the start of the gesture), expressed in milliseconds.

## Example

```jsx
const longPressGesture = Gesture.LongPress().onEnd((e, success) => {
  if (success) {
    Alert.alert(`Long pressed for ${e.duration} ms!`);
  }
});

return (
  <GestureDetector gesture={longPressGesture}>
    <View style={styles.box} />
  </GestureDetector>
);
```
