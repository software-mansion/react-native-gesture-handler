A continuous gesture that can recognize hovering above the view it's attached to. The hover effect may be activated by moving a mouse or a stylus over the view.

On iOS additional visual effects may be configured.

## Reference

```jsx
import { GestureDetector, Gesture } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';

function App() {
  // highlight-next-line
  const hover = Gesture.Hover();

  return (
    <GestureDetector gesture={hover}>
      <View />
    </GestureDetector>
  );
}
```

## Config

### Properties specific to `HoverGesture`:

### `effect(effect: HoverEffect)` (iOS only)

```js
import { HoverEffect } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';
```

Visual effect applied to the view while the view is hovered. The possible values are:

- `HoverEffect.None`
- `HoverEffect.Lift`
- `HoverEffect.Highlight`

Defaults to `HoverEffect.None`

## Callbacks

<BaseEventCallbacks />
<BaseContinousEventCallbacks />

## Event data

### Event attributes specific to `HoverGesture`:

### `x`

X coordinate of the current position of the pointer relative to the view attached to the [`GestureDetector`](/docs/gestures/gesture-detector). Expressed in point units.

### `y`

Y coordinate of the current position of the pointer relative to the view attached to the [`GestureDetector`](/docs/gestures/gesture-detector). Expressed in point units.

### `absoluteX`

X coordinate of the current position of the pointer relative to the window. The value is expressed in point units. It is recommended to use it instead of [`x`](#x) in cases when the original view can be transformed as an effect of the gesture.

### `absoluteY`

Y coordinate of the current position of the pointer relative to the window. The value is expressed in point units. It is recommended to use it instead of [`y`](#y) in cases when the original view can be transformed as an effect of the gesture.

## Remarks

- Don't rely on `Hover` gesture to continue after the mouse button is clicked or the stylus touches the screen. If you want to handle both cases, [compose](/docs/fundamentals/gesture-composition) it with [`Pan` gesture](/docs/gestures/pan-gesture).
