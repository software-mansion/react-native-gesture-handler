Gesture Handler provides a declarative API exposing the native platform's touch and gesture system to React Native. It's designed to be a replacement of React Native's built in touch system called [Gesture Responder System](http://reactnative.dev/docs/gesture-responder-system). Using native touch handling allows to address the performance limitations of React Native's Gesture Responder System. It also provides more control over the platform's native components that can handle gestures on their own. If you want to learn more, we recommend [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8maYc4R2G0) by [Krzysztof Magiera](https://twitter.com/kzzzf) in which he explains issues with the responder system.

The main benefits of using React Native Gesture Handler are:

- A way to use a platform's native touch handling system for recognizing gestures (like pinch, rotation, pan and a few others).
- The ability to define relations between gestures to ensure gestures, and possibly native components, will not conflict with each other.
- Mechanisms to use touchable components that run in native thread and follow platform default behavior; e.g. in the event they are in a scrollable component, turning into pressed state is slightly delayed to prevent it from highlighting when you fling.
- Close integration with [`react-native-reanimated`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) to process touch events on the UI thread.
- Support for different input devices like touch screens, pens and mice.
- Ability to include any native component into the Gesture Handler's touch system, making it work alongside your gestures.

:::info
We recommended to use Reanimated to implement gesture-driven animations with Gesture Handler. Its more advanced features rely heavily on worklets and the UI runtime provided by Reanimated.
