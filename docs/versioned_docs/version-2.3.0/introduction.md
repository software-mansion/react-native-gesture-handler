Gesture Handler aims to replace React Native's built in touch system called [Gesture Responder System](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/gesture-responder-system).

The motivation for building this library was to address the performance limitations of React Native's Gesture Responder System and to provide more control over the built-in native components that can handle gestures.
We recommend [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8maYc4R2G0) by [Krzysztof Magiera](https://twitter.com/kzzzf) in which he explains issues with the responder system.

In a nutshell, the library provides:

- A way to use a platform's native touch handling system for recognizing pinch, rotation and pan (besides a few other gestures).
- The ability to define relations between gesture handlers, e.g. when you have a pan handler in `ScrollView` you can make that `ScrollView` wait until it knows pan won't recognize.
- Mechanisms to use touchables that run in native thread and follow platform default behavior; e.g. in the event they are in a scrollable component, turning into pressed state is slightly delayed to prevent it from highlighting when you fling.

It is recommended to use Reanimated 2 for animations when using React Native Gesture Handler as its more advanced features rely heavily on the worklets provided by Reanimated.

## RNGH 2.0

RNGH2 introduces a new way of creating gestures. Instead of creating a gesture handler component for every gesture you want to create, you just need to create a `GestureDetector` component and assign to it all the gestures you want it to recognize. It is also designed to work seamlessly with `Reanimated 2` and it will automatically detect if it is installed, and start using it if it is.
You can create gestures using the `Gesture` object and methods it provides, and configure them in the builder-like pattern. If you want to specify behavior between the gestures instead of using `waitFor` and `simultaneousGestures` you can use the new system of [gesture composition](./gesture-composition).
Along the new API, version 2.0 brings one of the most requested features: [pointer events and manual gestures](./manual-gestures/manual-gestures). Thanks to great work done by the Reanimated team, we were able to provide synchronous communication between gestures and their native implementation using worklets. This allows to manage gesture state from the JS without risking race-conditions.

### Interoperability with gesture handlers

The new API with gestures is somewhat compatible with the old gesture handlers. Unfortunately you cannot use the new gesture composing with gesture handlers, however you can still mark relations using refs. If you want to make a gesture handler wait for (or simultaneous with) a gesture, simply use withRef method on the gesture to set the ref object and pass it to the appropriate property on the gesture handler.

Similarly, if you want to make a gesture simultaneous with (or wait for failure of) a gesture handler, set the ref prop of the gesture handler and pass the same ref to the simultaneousWithExternalGesture or requireExternalGestureToFail method on the gesture object.

This should allow you to migrate your codebase from the gesture handlers to gestures smoothly and at your own pace. Just keep in mind that the gesture handlers cannot have the GestureDetector as their direct child, as it's a functional component.
