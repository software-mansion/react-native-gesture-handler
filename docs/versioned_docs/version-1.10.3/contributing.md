If you are interested in the project and want to contribute or support it in other ways don't hesitate to contact [me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kzzzf)!

All PRs are welcome, but talk to us before you start working on something big.

The easiest way to get started with contributing code is by:
 - Reviewing the list of [open issues](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/issues) and trying to solve the one that seem approachable to you.
 - Updating the [documentation](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/blob/main/docs) whenever you see some information is unclear, missing or out of date.

Code is only one way how you can contribute. You may want to consider [replying on issues](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/issues) if you know how to help.
