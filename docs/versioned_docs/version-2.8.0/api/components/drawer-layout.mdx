This is a cross-platform replacement for React Native's [DrawerLayoutAndroid](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/drawerlayoutandroid.html) component. It provides a compatible API but allows for the component to be used on both Android and iOS. Please refer to [React Native docs](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/drawerlayoutandroid.html) for the detailed usage for standard parameters.

## Usage:

`DrawerLayout` component isn't exported by default from the `react-native-gesture-handler` package. To use it, import it in the following way:

```js
import DrawerLayout from 'react-native-gesture-handler/DrawerLayout';
```

## Properties:

On top of the standard list of parameters DrawerLayout has an additional set of attributes to customize its behavior. Please refer to the list below:

### `drawerType`

possible values are: `front`, `back` or `slide` (default is `front`). It specifies the way the drawer will be displayed. When set to `front` the drawer will slide in and out along with the gesture and will display on top of the content view. When `back` is used the drawer displays behind the content view and can be revealed with gesture of pulling the content view to the side. Finally `slide` option makes the drawer appear like it is attached to the side of the content view; when you pull both content view and drawer will follow the gesture.

Type `slide`:

  <img src={useBaseUrl('gifs/drawer-slide.gif')} width="280" />
</GifGallery>

Type `front`:

<GifGallery>
  <img src={useBaseUrl('gifs/drawer-front.gif')} width="280" />
</GifGallery>

Type `back`:

<GifGallery>
  <img src={useBaseUrl('gifs/drawer-back.gif')} width="280" />
</GifGallery>

### `edgeWidth`

number, allows for defining how far from the edge of the content view the gesture should activate.

### `hideStatusBar`

boolean, when set to `true` Drawer component will use [StatusBar](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/statusbar.html) API to hide the OS status bar whenever the drawer is pulled or when its in an "open" state.

### `statusBarAnimation`

possible values are: `slide`, `none` or `fade` (defaults to `slide`). Can be used when `hideStatusBar` is set to `true` and will select the animation used for hiding/showing the status bar. See [StatusBar](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/statusbar.html#statusbaranimation) documentation for more details.

### `overlayColor`

color (default to `"black"`) of a semi-transparent overlay to be displayed on top of the content view when drawer gets open. A solid color should be used as the opacity is added by the Drawer itself and the opacity of the overlay is animated (from 0% to 70%).

### `renderNavigationView`

function. This attribute is present in the standard implementation already and is one of the required params. Gesture handler version of DrawerLayout make it possible for the function passed as `renderNavigationView` to take an Animated value as a parameter that indicates the progress of drawer opening/closing animation (progress value is 0 when closed and 1 when opened). This can be used by the drawer component to animated its children while the drawer is opening or closing.

### `onDrawerClose`

function. This function is called when the drawer is closed.

### `onDrawerOpen`

function. This function is called when the drawer is opened.

### `onDrawerSlide`

function. This function is called as a drawer sliding open from touch events. The progress of the drawer opening/closing is passed back as 0 when closed and 1 when opened.

### `onDrawerStateChanged`

function. This function is called when the status of the drawer changes. Possible values that can be passed back are: 'Idle', 'Dragging', and 'Settling'.

### `enableTrackpadTwoFingerGesture` (iOS only)

Enables two-finger gestures on supported devices, for example iPads with trackpads. If not enabled the gesture will require click + drag, with enableTrackpadTwoFingerGesture swiping with two fingers will also trigger the gesture.

### `children`

component or function. Children is a component which is rendered by default and is wrapped by drawer. However, it could be also a render function which takes an Animated value as a parameter that indicates the progress of drawer opening/closing animation (progress value is 0 when closed and 1 when opened) is the same way like `renderNavigationView` prop.

## Methods

### `openDrawer(options)`

`openDrawer` can take an optional `options` parameter which is an object, enabling further customization of the open animation.

`options` has two optional properties:

`velocity`: number, the initial velocity of the object attached to the spring. Default 0 (object is at rest).
`speed`: number, controls speed of the animation. Default 12.

### `closeDrawer(options)`

`closeDrawer` can take an optional `options` parameter which is an object, enabling further customization of the close animation.

`options` has two optional properties:

`velocity`: number, the initial velocity of the object attached to the spring. Default 0 (object is at rest).
`speed`: number, controls speed of the animation. Default 12.

## Example:

See the [drawer example](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/blob/main/examples/Example/src/horizontalDrawer/index.tsx) from GestureHandler Example App or view it directly on your phone by visiting [our expo demo](https://snack.expo.io/@adamgrzybowski/react-native-gesture-handler-demo).

```js
class Drawerable extends Component {
  handleDrawerSlide = (status) => {
    // outputs a value between 0 and 1
    console.log(status);
  };

  renderDrawer = () => {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>I am in the drawer!</Text>
      </View>
    );
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <DrawerLayout
          drawerWidth={200}
          drawerPosition={DrawerLayout.positions.Right}
          drawerType="front"
          drawerBackgroundColor="#ddd"
          renderNavigationView={this.renderDrawer}
          onDrawerSlide={this.handleDrawerSlide}>
          <View>
            <Text>Hello, it's me</Text>
          </View>
        </DrawerLayout>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
