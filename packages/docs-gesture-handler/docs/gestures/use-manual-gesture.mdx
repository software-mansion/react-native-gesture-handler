A plain gesture that has no specific activation criteria nor event data set. Its state has to be controlled manually using a [state manager](/docs/fundamentals/state-manager). It will not fail when all the pointers are lifted from the screen.

:::tip
If you need to modify the activation criteria of gestures other than `Manual`, check their configuration for relevant properties or use `manualActivation` to manage their state directly.
:::

## Example

To demonstrate how to make a manual gesture we will make a simple one that tracks all pointers on the screen.

<Step title="Step 1">
    First, we need a way to store information about the pointer: whether it should be visible and its position.
    <Step1 />
</Step>

<Step title="Step 2">
    We also need a component to mark where a pointer is. In order to accomplish that we will make a component that accepts two [shared values](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/glossary#shared-value): one holding information about the pointer using the interface we just created, the other holding a bool indicating whether the gesture has activated.
    In this example when the gesture is not active, the ball representing it will be blue and when it is active the ball will be red and slightly bigger.
    <Step2 />
</Step>

<Step title="Step 3">
    Now we have to make a component that will handle the gesture and draw all the pointer indicators. We will store data about pointers in an array and render them inside an [`Animated.View`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/your-first-animation#using-an-animated-component).
    <Step3 />
</Step>

<Step title="Step 4">
    We have our components set up and we can finally get to making the gesture! We will start with `onTouchesDown` where we need to set position of the pointers and make them visible. We can get this information from the touches property of the event. In this case we will also check how many pointers are on the screen and activate the gesture if there are at least two.
    <Step4 />
</Step>

<Step title="Step 5">
    Next, we will handle pointer movement. In `onTouchesMove` we will simply update the position of moved pointers.
    <Step5 />
</Step>

<Step title="Step 6">
    We also need to handle lifting fingers from the screen, which corresponds to `onTouchesUp`. Here we will just hide the pointers that were lifted and end the gesture if there are no more pointers on the screen.
    Note that we are not handling `onTouchesCancel` as in this very basic case we don't expect it to happen, however you should clear data about cancelled pointers (most of the time all active ones) when it is called.
    <Step6 />
</Step>

<Step title="Step 7">
    Now that our pointers are being tracked correctly and we have the state management, we can handle activation and ending of the gesture. In our case, we will simply set the active shared value either to `true` or `false`.
    <Step7 />
</Step>

## Modifying existing gestures

While manual gestures open great possibilities we are aware that reimplementing pinch or rotation from scratch just because you need to activate in specific circumstances or require position of the fingers, would be a waste of time as those gestures are already available. Therefore, you can use touch events with every gesture to extract more detailed information about the gesture than what the basic events alone provide. We also added a `manualActivation` modifier on all continuous gestures, which prevents the gesture it is applied to from activating automatically, giving you full control over its behavior.
