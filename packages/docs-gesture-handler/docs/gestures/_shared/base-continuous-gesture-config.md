### manualActivation

```ts
manualActivation: boolean | SharedValue<boolean>;
```

When `true` the handler will not activate by itself even if its activation criteria are met. Instead you can manipulate its state using [`GestureStateManager`](/docs/fundamentals/state-manager). Example usage can be found [here](/docs/fundamentals/state-manager#manualactivation).
