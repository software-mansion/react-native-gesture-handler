It\'s designed to be a replacement of React Native\'s built in touch system called Gesture Responder System. Using native touch handling allows to address the performance limitations of React Native\'s Gesture Responder System. It also provides more control over the platform\'s native components that can handle gestures on their own. If you want to learn more, we recommend this talk by Krzysztof Magiera in which he explains issues with the responder system.","source":"@site/versioned_docs/version-2.x/fundamentals/introduction.md","sourceDirName":"fundamentals","slug":"/","permalink":"/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/2.x/","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/edit/main/docs/versioned_docs/version-2.x/fundamentals/introduction.md","tags":[],"version":"2.x","sidebarPosition":1,"frontMatter":{"id":"introduction","title":"Introduction","sidebar_label":"Introduction","sidebar_position":1,"slug":"/"},"sidebar":"tutorialSidebar","previous":{"title":"Fundamentals","permalink":"/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/2.x/category/fundamentals"},"next":{"title":"Installation","permalink":"/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/2.x/fundamentals/installation"}},{"id":"fundamentals/states-events","title":"Gesture states & events","description":"Every gesture can be treated as \\"state machine\\".","source":"@site/versioned_docs/version-2.x/fundamentals/states-events.mdx","sourceDirName":"fundamentals","slug":"/fundamentals/states-events","permalink":"/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/2.x/fundamentals/states-events","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/edit/main/docs/versioned_docs/version-2.x/fundamentals/states-events.mdx","tags":[],"version":"2.x","sidebarPosition":4,"frontMatter":{"id":"states-events","title":"Gesture states & events","sidebar_label":"Gesture states & events","sidebar_position":4},"sidebar":"tutorialSidebar","previous":{"title":"Gesture composition & interactions","permalink":"/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/2.x/fundamentals/gesture-composition"},"next":{"title":"Guides","permalink":"/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/2.x/category/guides"}},{"id":"gesture-handlers/about-handlers","title":"About Gesture Handlers","description":"The old API will be removed in the future version of Gesture Handler.
