handler library provides native components that can act as buttons. These can be treated as a replacement to TouchableHighlight or TouchableOpacity from RN core. Gesture handler\'s buttons recognize touches in native which makes the recognition process deterministic, allows for rendering ripples on Android in highly performant way (TouchableNativeFeedback requires that touch event does a roundtrip to JS before we can update ripple effect, which makes ripples lag a bit on older phones), and provides native and platform default interaction for buttons that are placed in a scrollable container (in which case the interaction is slightly delayed to prevent button from highlighting when you fling).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"components/pressable":{"id":"components/pressable","title":"Pressable","description":"This component is a drop-in replacement for the Pressable component.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"components/reanimated_swipeable":{"id":"components/reanimated_swipeable","title":"Reanimated Swipeable","description":"This component is a drop-in replacement for the Swipeable component, rewritten using Reanimated.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"components/reanimated-drawer-layout":{"id":"components/reanimated-drawer-layout","title":"Reanimated Drawer Layout","description":"This component acts as a cross-platform replacement for React Native\'s DrawerLayoutAndroid component, written using Reanimated.

It\'s designed to be a replacement of React Native\'s built in touch system called Gesture Responder System. Using native touch handling allows to address the performance limitations of React Native\'s Gesture Responder System. It also provides more control over the platform\'s native components that can handle gestures on their own. If you want to learn more, we recommend this talk by Krzysztof Magiera in which he explains issues with the responder system.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"fundamentals/reanimated-interactions":{"id":"fundamentals/reanimated-interactions","title":"Integration with Reanimated","description":"GestureDetector will decide whether to use Reanimated to process provided gestures based on their configuration.
