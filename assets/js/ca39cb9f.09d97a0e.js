Gesture Handler library offers native components that function as buttons, serving as alternatives to TouchableHighlight or TouchableOpacity from the core React Native framework. These buttons process touch recognition natively, which ensures a deterministic response. This capability significantly enhances performance; for example, it allows for immediate ripple effects on Android, unlike TouchableNativeFeedback, which requires a touch event roundtrip to JavaScript that can cause delays, especially noticeable on older devices. Additionally, these components handle default platform interactions natively, particularly in scrollable containers where interactions are smartly delayed to prevent unintended highlighting during a fling.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"components/create-native-wrapper":{"id":"components/create-native-wrapper","title":"createNativeWrapper","description":"createNativeWrapper is a function that lets you wrap components which are not provided by Gesture Handler with a Native gesture, allowing them to participate in the gesture recognition process.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"components/pressable":{"id":"components/pressable","title":"Pressable","description":"This component is a drop-in replacement for the Pressable component.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"components/reanimated_swipeable":{"id":"components/reanimated_swipeable","title":"Reanimated Swipeable","description":"This component is a drop-in replacement for the Swipeable component, rewritten using Reanimated.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"components/reanimated-drawer-layout":{"id":"components/reanimated-drawer-layout","title":"Reanimated Drawer Layout","description":"This component acts as a cross-platform replacement for React Native\'s DrawerLayoutAndroid component, written using Reanimated.

It\'s designed to be a replacement of React Native\'s built in touch system called Gesture Responder System. Using native touch handling allows to address the performance limitations of React Native\'s Gesture Responder System. It also provides more control over the platform\'s native components that can handle gestures on their own. If you want to learn more, we recommend this talk by Krzysztof Magiera in which he explains issues with the responder system.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"fundamentals/reanimated-interactions":{"id":"fundamentals/reanimated-interactions","title":"Integration with Reanimated","description":"GestureDetector will decide whether to use Reanimated to process provided gestures based on their configuration.
