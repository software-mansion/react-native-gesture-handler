Gesture handler\'s buttons recognize touches in native which makes the recognition process deterministic, allows for rendering ripples on Android in highly performant way (TouchableNativeFeedback requires that touch event does a roundtrip to JS before we can update ripple effect, which makes ripples lag a bit on older phones), and provides native and platform default interaction for buttons that are placed in a scrollable container (in which case the interaction is slightly delayed to prevent button from highlighting when you fling).","sidebar":"docs"},"api/components/drawer-layout":{"id":"api/components/drawer-layout","title":"Drawer Layout","description":"This is a cross-platform replacement for React Native\'s DrawerLayoutAndroid component.
